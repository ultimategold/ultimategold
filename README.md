### My expertise lies in problem-solving, and I have honed my analytical mindset through extensive experience in Python, Golang, and PowerBI. In my most recent role at Sustained, I built a sustainability calculator that demonstrated my proficiency in data analytics. I am dedicated to staying ahead of the curve in rapidly evolving industries and consistently adapt my skills to meet the demands of changing markets.
